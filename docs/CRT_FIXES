We don't use builder bits; just #define Builder() as (1).

Our player birthroom is #2, not #0.

We allow '==" and ;==:

I make prim_online mucker level 1.
Also conddbref, conidle, contime

We use -lmalloc

I allow @pcreate even with REGISTRATION off.

We've dropped NEXTPROP and PROPDIR? to M2.

I don't normally log wiz commands.  CODEWIZARD now excepted.

I comment out the game.c and interface.c default 'log_command()' logging.

We add some stuff to wiz.c:do_usage().

My interface.c check_connect(), aside from having
the reg_* hacks, logs d->hostname, not just d->descriptor.

I leave DOUBLING on but change it to actually grow by 10%
increments rather than 100% increments.

Added a "db_clear_object(newobj); /* CrT */" to db.c:new_object()
'else' clause, it seemed to be crashing on
do_dig -> new_object -> db_free_object -> free()

I add a
    OWNER(thing) = GOD;  /* CrT */
at end of move.c:recycle(), so people don't own their garbage.

We changed game.c:process_command() to allow mortals to use !@edi
!@lis and !l overrides to get native server code.

Changed interface.c:check_connect to log pw on failed tries, mostly
so I can diagnose people who fail to connect.

I fix timequeue.c next_timequeue_event() main loop to not crash
on null tqhead.

We fix timestamps(?) prim to be M3.

We change 'gripe' command to require three letter prefix.

We change @toad to not do it if *name/@/precious:{any}

Fb5.24 cores if we sweep someone who is INTERACTIVE.  We add a
check to p_misc.c:prim_force() to prevent this.

On Mumford's request, p_db.c:prim_moveto has one check commented out.

On Kurane's request, db.c:log_program_text uses folding-mode format.

We turn off all the Builder() restrictions in create.c
