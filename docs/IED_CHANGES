******************************** 3.2.1 Release ********************************
2012-May-09: Added blank? and empty? primitives
2012-Apr-29: Added a tune to control whether MUF division/modulus by zero
             returns an error.
2012-Apr-27: Added a tune to make the 'home' command string configurable.
2012-Apr-14: Added DASH_TOKEN to example local.h
2012-Mar-20: * Added recording the port connected on the association
	       connection.
             * Added ability to display different welcome screens based on
	       which ported was connected to.
             * Added MUF primitive 'con_listener_port' so that MUF programs
               can detect which port a connection connected to.
2011-Apr-17: Added rudimentary support for MSSP.

2007-Mar-29: Fixed issue for systems where sys/wait isn't available and
             socklen_t isn't defined
2011-Mar-26: Events that used "Queued Event." were inconsistent. They all
             now use the same string. man.txt documentation updates.
2009-Dec-19: @tune documentation updates.
2009-Oct-17: man.txt documentation updates.
2007-Mar-13: Changed makefile so it would more intelligently do dependency
             based compiles.
2007-Mar-10: Changed the default maximum stack size.
2007-Mar-10: Added floating point types to MUF and added the following prims:
	     float?, float, atof
2006-Jul-28: @tune documentation updates. help.txt documentation updates
2005-Oct-10: Fixed some issues that caused gcc 4.x to generate warnings.
2005-Sep-25: INIT now reports glow version. Various help file updates.
2005-Sep-24: Fixed bug where if a player had negative pennies, and the cost
             to create something was set to 0, it would tell them they had
             insufficient funds. Inserted several checks to guarantee that
             should prevent a player from paying any amount for creating
             an exit, thing, room, open, or link.
2005-Sep-21: Changed some permission denied messages to be more comprehensible.
2005-Sep-20: Fixed error message displayed when a guest attempts to use an
             exit that isn't permitted for a guest.
2005-Sep-17: Added the new 'email_password' muf primitive.
2005-Sep-13: Changed date format for the 'id' property.
2005-Sep-11: Added the FD_SETSIZE define to allow compile time control of
             the descriptor limit.
2005-Sep-09: help.txt updated.
2005-Aug-15: Tightened @force security in regards to inter-wizard forcing.

******************************** 3.2.0 Release ********************************
2005-Apr-27: Revised the color support so that an alternate color can be
             specified so you still have color even if you don't support 256
             colors. For example: ^256FG-505:VIOLET^ will display in violet
             for non-256 color users.
2005-Apr-26: Added some inserver defines. The now classic debug-on, debug-off,
             and debug-line macros are now inserver defines. I also added the
             symbol __prefs_propdir which by default points to _prefs, can be
             changed via a #define in local.h...compare to config.h. I also
             added __pref_256colors, which is the property pathname of the
             prop used to determine whether the player wants 256color support.
2005-Apr-25: Support for xterm's 256 color mode added. This adds two additional
             color codes: ^256BG-xxx^ (background) and ^256FG-xxx^ (foreground)
             xxx represents three numbers ranging from 0-5 these each represent
             red, green, and blue. Additionally, gray scale colors can be
             selected in the form: ^256BG-Gxx^ where xx is a number between
             0 and 24.
2005-Mar-11: Updated MUF error output for logwall to reflect who generated
             the error and what command they used.
2005-Mar-10: Fixed flaw in the notify_descriptor primitive that would cause
             the server to crash if an incorrect value was passed.
2005-Mar-08: Added the muf primitive 'proctime' which returns the time until
             the next execution of an enqueued muf process.
             Added the @heartbeat property queue. Any programs set in that
             queue will be executed every 15 seconds (or whatever BASE_PULSE
             is set to).
2004-Dec-12: Added feature to @hopper to allow a wizard to delete entries
             from the list.
2004-Dec-11: Fixed issue where the code preventing aliases to be rewritten
	     programmatically (proven to be a security risk in the past) was
	     also preventing programs from using 'alias' as a property name
	     even when it wasn't referring to the alias property dir.
2004-Apr-20: Fixed the problem where wiz-owned zombies could use a Z-exit even
             when the wizard was set quell.
             If the new tune exit_guest_flag is set to 'yes', no guest can
             use an exit unless the exit is set 'G'. If the tune is set to
             'no' all exits except those set 'G' can be used by a guest.
             The preferred method would be to tune to 'yes', and go through
   	     and carefully set those commands that a guest needs to be able
             to use 'G'.
2004-Apr-03: Updated the restart files for the windows platform to be a little
             more intelligent. 
2004-Mar-18: Hopefully, I've correctly corrected the variable conversions in
             compress.c and interface.c that were causing MSVC to generate
             warnings. Fixed the trigraph warning thrown out by gcc in
             interface.c and the "operation on 'prop' is undefined"
             error. Fixed the "operation on curpath is undefined" error in
             path.c.
