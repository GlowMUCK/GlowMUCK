2004-Dec-11: Fixed issue where the code preventing aliases to be rewritten
	     programmatically (proven to be a security risk in the past) was
	     also preventing programs from using 'alias' as a property name
	     even when it wasn't referring to the alias property dir.

2004-Apr-20: Fixed the problem where wiz-owned zombies could use a Z-exit even
             when the wizard was set quell.
             If the new tune exit_guest_flag is set to 'yes', no guest can
             use an exit unless the exit is set 'G'. If the tune is set to
             'no' all exits except those set 'G' can be used by a guest.
             The preferred method would be to tune to 'yes', and go through
   	     and carefully set those commands that a guest needs to be able
             to use 'G'.

2004-Apr-03: Updated the restart files for the windows platform to be a little
             more intelligent. 

2004-Mar-18: Hopefully, I've correctly corrected the variable conversions in
             compress.c and interface.c that were causing MSVC to generate
             warnings. Fixed the trigraph warning thrown out by gcc in
             interface.c and the "operation on 'prop' is undefined"
             error. Fixed the "operation on curpath is undefined" error in
             path.c.
