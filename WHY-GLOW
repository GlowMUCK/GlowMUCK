## Introduction ##

    I created the GlowMuck server from wanting a few additional features to
    the special Fuzzball server hacked by Cynbe for QWest Muck.  As any
    programmer knows, you can't stop with just one feep. ;) Some of the
    major additions to stock 5.xx Fuzzball include but are not limited to:


## Fancy Features List ##

**  VT102/ANSI Color added in-server with Muf & MPI support also.  99.44% of
    in-server commands have been colorized.  Color muf proggies available.

**  WWW http server on separate port, lsedit or redirected home page support
    on a per-player and global basis, special /@WHO cgi-like feeps.

**  Automatic online player creation and registration with e-mail verification.

**  In-Server word-wrapping for raw telnet clients that can't do it.

**  In-Server --More-- style paging ala tinyfugue.  Use Return instead of Tab.

**  Command aliases with $0-$9,$-0-$-9,$*,$$ tinyfugue-like macro substitution.

**  In-server lead/follow system working with both paths and room exits.

**  Basic Pueblo support (requires some muf/MPI additions)


## C-Code and Compiling Features ##

**  100% 64 bit clean, GNU-C -Wall clean, the only known Fuzzball server code
    to date capable of running on 64 bit unix boxes ala the Dec Alpha.

**  Fixed the problem compiling on Linux with 'ld' signal 6 dying.


##  Administration Features ##

**  Three Wizard levels and a MPI 'meeper' level for additional flexibility
    and security of precious e-mail address and mail content information.

**  Very extended in-server security site blocking options with ability to
    disable guest logins and auto-registration on a site or domain basis.

**  Custom random or specific welcome screens set on a site or domain basis.

**  Many new wizard options such as status log @walling to wizards.


## Misc Feeps ##

**  Fast in-server muf 'sort' prim speeds up muf-page, cmd-find, etc.

**  An in-server copy of the resolver to store and retrieve site names for
    faster hostname resolving when sites first connect.  Once a site
    connects the name/number is stored in a file for future retrieval.


## In Progress ##

**  An in-server real time combat option, still in alpha coding.
