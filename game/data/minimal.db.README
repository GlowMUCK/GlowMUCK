Notes to new administrators using minimal.db:

1. There is one objects of type player in minimal.db: One(#1), with
the password "potrzebie."  One is the administrative player; it has
its WIZARD bit set, and it owns everything.

2. minimal.db contains no unlinked exits; thus it will be impossible
for anybody who is not a WIZARD to connect new rooms to the core
rooms.
