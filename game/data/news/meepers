Meeper are given out with relative freedom.  Players are encouraged to try
out any programs that are in good taste and do not violate any muck policy
or rules.  All bits are granted on a revokable basis.

To use MPI on any object you must @set object=M  Then use the @set command
to add MPI programs to the @desc, @succ, @osucc, etc. of the object.

Any programs found to be of a suspicious nature will be confiscated and if
need be the owner debitted or possibly disinvited.  This includes confusing
programs that we can't figure out or trojan horses.  All MPI programs on the
muck are considered to be grants of free license for use, copying, and
examination by the muck, its staff, and future derivatives of the muck.  If
you don't like this, don't upload your programs.

Information on MPI commands is available using the 'mpi' command along with
information from the 'info' and 'news' commands.
