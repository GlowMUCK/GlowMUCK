Read the building section of the help files (help index2) and commands
available there.  Also try 'info building' for how to use lsedit, @path, and
@object/@details.  It is very very expensive not to learn to use them as
@paths and @objects are free but regular objects and exits cost 10x the
price of a room.  Just an economic incentive for the pursuit of education!

If you need more pobbles to build an area, talk to wizstaff with an idea of
about how big an area you'd like to build would be.  A basic pobble estimate
would be helpful too.  Rooms are 100, exits and objects 1000, @linking,
@paths, @objects, and @details are all free.  Players start with 100 pobbles.
Thus each player can create 5 interconnected rooms on startup without any
undue grovelling. *grin*

For the most part, building areas is what the muck has been designed around. 
Players are encouraged to create interesting places to explore, role play,
or just chat in.  To promote this, objects and exits are limited to just a
few per player so the muck doesn't bloat with a lot of trinkets that are
usually forgotten.  Most mucks are roughly 50% exits.  The 'path' system we
use cuts our database bloating in half alone.  Talk to wizstaff if you need
help learning how to use our rapid area-building techniques and commands.
