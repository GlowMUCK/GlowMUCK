The theme in the central area of Legacy is based on medievil times with a
fantasy aura.  Other areas may cover different time periods and places. 

Areas are accessed using a global teleport system, walking through rooms, or
other means of commute.

It would be desirable to maintain a basic flow between areas, but this is
a fairly open policy.  Talk to wizards to link your areas to where they
would best fit in with other areas of the muck.
