Muffer bits are going to be given out with relative freedom.  Players are
encouraged to try out any programs that are in good taste and do not violate
any muck policy or rules.  All muffer bits are granted on a revokable basis. 

Temporary bits may be given in some situations under the understanding that
they will eventually be reset back to their previous state.  Players who do
not log in for a while may have their bits removed until they return.

Basic nonos: Scanners, listeners, harassers, and spammers.  Obey privacy and
permission settings to prevent abuse.  When in doubt, ask a wizard.

Any programs found to be of a suspicious nature will be confiscated and if
need be the owner debitted or possibly disinvited.  This includes confusing
programs that we can't figure out or trojan horses.  All programs uploaded
are considered to be grants of free license for use, copying, and archiving
by the muck, its staff, and future derivatives of the muck.  If you don't
like this, don't upload your programs.

Information on MUF is available using the 'muf' command. Muffing tutorials
and hints are found with 'info' while policy is in 'news'.
