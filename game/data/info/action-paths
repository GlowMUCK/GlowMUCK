To create an action with @path, follow these simple steps:

1. @path <verb>=here
2. @hide <verb>
3. @lock <verb>=me&!me
4. @desc <verb>=<description>
5. @fail <verb>=You <do something...>
6. @ofail <verb>=<does something...>

Example: (A simple 'sit' action)

1. @path sit;sit down=here
2. @hide sit
3. @lock sit=me&!me
4. @desc sit=Type 'sit' to sit down.
5. @fail sit=You sit down.
6. @ofail sit=sits down.

It's as simple as that!  Put all the verb names you want after the @path
statement in step #1 and separate them by semicolons.
