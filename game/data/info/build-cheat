You can use 'me' instead of 'here' to do these to yourself where applicable.
You can also do them on an object or exit if it is suitable.

Multi-line editor:
  lsedit here=_desc ... When done save by typing '.end' alone on a line
  @set here=M       ... ask a wizard for an MPI bit to be able to set this
  @desc here={list:_desc}

Exits and Paths: @settings work in parent rooms, @succ is needed in each room
  @succ here=@$cmd/path ... Enable obvious exit lister here
  @path direction=#room=Name of Path ... make a path to room
  @set here=_BigExits:yes ... One path per line, big display
  @set here=_NoDestRooms:yes ... No destinations for BigExits
  @set here=_PrependExits:yes ... Put <> exit before BigExits
  @set here=_ExitsCalled:[Doors] or >Paths< or Planes: or Goats
