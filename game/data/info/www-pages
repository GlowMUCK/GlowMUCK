This muck has WWW web pages built into the muck.  Each player can create
their own home pages using either lsedit or setting pointers to other home 
pages on the net.  User home pages are accessed with:

  http://legacy.muq.org:9998/~yournamehere

You can also create a whole tree of pages like a real home page.  All home 
pages go in your _/www directory on your player.  The _/www property itself is
the root page, accessed as above.  If you have a homepage somewhere else you
would like to be your main home page here, type: (substituting your link in)

  @set me=_/www:http://www.youraddress.here

If you don't have a homepage anywhere on the net, you can write one and use
/quote in tinyfugue or 'ascii send' in most terminal programs to load it into
lsedit, or type it in by hand.  The basic sequence is:

  lsedit me=_/www
  <insert your home page text here line by line>
  .end

Lastly, to create other pages under the root page, just put the name of 
the page after the _/www/, ie: (this works for both lsedit and redirections)

  @set me=_/www/search:http://www.yahoo.com       would make
  http://legacy.muq.org:9998/~yourname/search     go to that web address.
