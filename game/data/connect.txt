  
  
TO CONNECT TO YOUR CHARACTER... (if you have one)
  
  Type 'connect name password' (with no quotes) where 'name'
  is the name of your character, and 'password' is its password.
  
TO EXPLORE AS A GUEST... (if you don't have a character)
  
  Type 'connect guest' and you will be connected to a guest character.
  
TO GET YOUR OWN CHARACTER... (if you would like one of your own)
  
  Type 'request name your@email.address Your RealName' where 'name' is the
  character name you would like.  We also need your email address and real
  name for recordkeeping.  A character will be created, and the password
  will be e-mailed to you.  You should receive the e-mail within minutes.
  
  Check on your character's status at the login screen or as a guest online
  anytime by typing 'note'.  If the e-mail sent to you bounces, we will add
  a note as soon as we discover it bounced.
