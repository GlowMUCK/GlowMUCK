To start a new DB, copy 'bare-db.db' to 'glow.db'.  In the game directory
type 'restart' after copying a compiled glowmuck executable from glow/src to
glow/game.

To log into the #1 character on GlowMuck, use 'telnet localhost 9999' unless
you changed the port number in glow/bin/restart.

To shut the muck down, type: @shutdown GlowMuck

You can set your own muck name with: @tune muckname=Your Muck Name
You will then have to use this name when shutting the muck down or
restarting it online.  You can also perform a safe shutdown with no data
loss if you do a normal (not -9 SIGQUIT) kill on the glowmuck process.

Edit ../bin/newuser to personalize it for your muck.

Change the data/welcome* screens for your muck.  Grep for references to
Legacy (shouldn't be many) in info or news files and change as appropriate.

Talk to me to get some of the muf programs such as @path or colorized
versions of programs like find, 3who, etc.  I hope to have a distribution
out someday soon.
