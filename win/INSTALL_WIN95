To use this download a standard glow-x.x.x.tgz distribution and unarchive it
with WinZip95 or some other un-tarring utility.

Copy the GlowMuck.exe this archive into glow\game.  You don't need to compile
any files for this Windows 95 setup.  You will however need to make sure you
have a valid welcome.txt file in your game\data directory.

One caveat of this code is that I have no idea how to make newuser work with
Windows 95.  I need a mail executable that works like the unix mail or mailx
command does.  So right now the only way to make players is @pcreate.  I did
re-add the 'create' login command.

This executable is self contained.  It does NOT use the Cygnus GCC libraries,
it is a pure Windows 95/NT Win32 console application and can be run from any
MS-Dos prompt or the Run menu item on the Start Menu.  The preferred way of
running the program is using the 'restart.bat' file included here.

I have also re-enabled compression so Dr. Cat compressed databases can be read
with this executable.  You need the wordlist.txt in the latest glowmuck executable
which was taken directly from fuzzball 5.56.  I highly recommend against ever
using topwords to optimize your database.  (Nothing against the utility, but
I have had database anomolies happen from optimized wordlists.)


*** SETUP ***

Untar a glowmuck file set from the .tar.gz or .tgz archive somewhere,
note the directory/drive.  If you use WinZip make sure you select
Options/Preferences and DISABLE Smart Tar CR/LF translation.  If you
do not you will get horrible database corruption errors.

Edit the restart.bat file (you can copy it to any location in your PATH
environment variable) to contain this directory and the names of your
databases as well as the port the muck runs on.

Type 'restart' to get the muck going.

To shut the muck down you can either @shutdown online or Press Ctrl-C
in the console window the muck is running in.  I'm not sure what happens
if you select the big X, I recommend using Ctrl-C, that IS the same as a
normal @shutdown on Glowmuck (but not normal fuzzball servers, beware).

*** DB CONVERSIONS ***
GlowMuck should be able to use any standard Fuzzball database, NeonMuck, or
previous GlowMuck database.  Unix linefeeds must be used in the database
file, to date all Win95 versions of Fuzzball TinyMucks use the Unix format.

If you are using a Neon database you will need to run the @fixwizbits
command to convert the wizbits to the new format.  Log in as #1 and
type 'help @fixwizbits'.

Send comments or bug reports to artie@muq.org.  If you see signal 11 - bailout,
I am very interested to know what happened!!!  (But make sure you turned that
CR/LF translation off!)
