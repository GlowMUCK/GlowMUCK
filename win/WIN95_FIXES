What it took to make Glowmuck compile with Windows 95:

Added WSAStartup/WSACleanup to interface.c and Windows Socket's structure.

Used recv()/send() instead of read()/write() for socket io.

Renamed read/write/close to xxxsocket to avoid confusion if we try to make
the resolver fork() trick work later on.

Changed the execl()s to use spawnl() instead since there is no fork() in
Windows 95/NT.  Came up with fixes for  getpid() and waitpid(), most of the
quirks are in config.h if you search for the section with win95conf.h in it.

Made gettimeofday() just use time() to set the timeval struct, only seconds
resolution seems to be available outside of select().

Added Foxen's fbwin.diff file to make the server properly read the different
linefeed format of Win95 vs Unix.  It appears to get rid of most of the
current oddities of the server.

Added perror()s to unlink()s in interface.c and added unlink()s before
rename()s in interface.c because Windows 95's unlink() command behaves
differently from unix's regarding files existing before the rename().
